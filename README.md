# CP measurement in H->TauTau decays

## Description

Here you can find the code used for the selection of H->TauTau decays, and for the use of Michael Williams' method and the CombinedLimit analisys.

## Use

To use this you simply need to run the file cphiggs.C and it excecutes the event selection (not yet implemented) and Michael Williams' method. It also produces a root file with histograms that can later be used for CombinedLimit.
